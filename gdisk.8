.SH NAME
gdisk \- GPT partition table manipulator for Linux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "gdisk "
[ \-l ]
.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
Hard disks can be divided into one or more segments, known as
.IR partitions .
This division is described in the
.I "partition table"
of the disk. Several different partition table formats exist, each with its
advantages and disadvantages.

The original partitioning system used on PCs, now known as the
.IR "MBR partitioning scheme",
is subject to several limitations. These include an awkward distinction
between
.IR "primary",
.IR "extended",
and
.IR "logical"
partitions; no redundancy or error correction capabilities; and 32-bit data
structures that, in conjunction with the common 512-byte sector size,
impose a hard 2 TiB limit on the size of partitions and disks. This final
drawback makes MBR partitions unsuitable for use on large hardware RAID
arrays. Individual disk sizes are expected to reach the 2 TiB limit in
2009, so MBR will become an unsuitable partitioning system even for
individual hard disks in the near future.

The successor to MBR partitions is the
.IR "Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT)"
system. GPT addresses each of the major limitations of MBR partitions, and
includes a dummy MBR partition table with a single
.IR "protective MBR"
entry to keep GPT-unaware programs from modifying the disk's GPT partitions. GPT
is a new partitioning scheme, though, and as such, older utilities and OSes
must be replaced or modified to handle GPT. Linux's venerable
.B "fdisk"
program, in particular, cannot process GPT disks. (The same is true of
related programs, such as
.B "sfdisk"
and
.BR "cfdisk".)
The alternative GNU
Parted and related programs, however, are capable of working on both MBR
and GPT disks.

GPT is often associated with the
.IR "Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)",
which is Intel's intended successor to the traditional (legacy) PC BIOS. It
is possible to use and even boot from GPT disks on non-EFI systems,
including those that use a legacy BIOS. Using GPT disks on such a system
isn't a great challenge, although the OS must support GPT. Booting from a
GPT-based disk requires that the OS support this action, and if the system
is BIOS-based, a GPT-aware boot loader is required. Patched versions of the
.IR "Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB)"
0.97, as well as GRUB2, support GPT.

GPT creates five distinct data structures of three types:
.TP
.B "Protective MBR"
The first sector (512 bytes) of the disk is devoted to an MBR that
consists of a single partition spanning the entire disk (or 2 TiB for disks
larger than this). The protective MBR may optionally include first-stage
boot loader code.
.TP
.B "GPT headers"
Two GPT headers exist, a main header and a backup header. The primary
header resides immediately after the protective MBR, and the backup header
is stored on the last sector of the disk. These headers contain disk
metadata, such as the location of the partition table, the size of the
partition table, and a "serial number" (GUID) that should be unique for
each disk. Each GPT header also stores two CRC checksums, one for the
partition table and one for the GPT header itself.
.TP
.B "Partition tables"
Each GPT header points to one partition table. The main partition table
appears immediately after the main GPT header, and the backup partition
table comes immediately before its GPT header. Typically, the partition
tables may hold data on up to 128 partitions, although
.B gdisk
enables you to change this value. Each entry contains 64-bit start and stop
sector numbers, a name, a partition GUID type code, a unique partition GUID
identifier, and additional data.
.PP

The GPT fdisk (aka
.BR "gdisk")
program operates mainly on the GPT headers and partition tables; however,
it can and will generate a fresh protective MBR, when required. (Any boot
loader code in the protective MBR will not be disturbed.) If you've created
an unusual protective MBR, such as a hybrid MBR created by
.IR "gptsync",
this should not be disturbed by most ordinary actions. Some advanced data
recovery options require you to understand the distinctions between the
main and backup data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition
tables.

The
.B "gdisk"
program employs a user interface similar to that of
.BR "fdisk",
but
.B "gdisk"
modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability of transforming MBR
partitions into GPT partitions. Like the original
.B fdisk
program,
.B gdisk
does not modify disk structures until you explicitly write them to disk, so
if you make a mistake, you can exit from the program with the 'q' option to
save your partitions.

.B gdisk
is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of
partition tables. It will automatically convert an MBR partition table to
GPT format, or will load a GPT partition table. When used with the
.IR "\-l"
command-line option, the program displays the current partition table and
then exits.

Linux hard disk device filenames take the form
.IR "/dev/sdx"
or
.IR "/dev/hdx",
where
.IR "x"
is a letter from
.IR "a"
onward. The
.IR "hdx"
devices originally referred to IDE (aka PATA) drives, whereas
.IR "sdx"
devices originally referred to SCSI drives. These distinctions are now
blurring. Modern SATA drives and USB flash drives usually acquire
.IR "sdx"
names, and the same can even be true of PATA drives, depending on kernel
driver options. For instance,
.IR "/dev/hda"
refers to the first PATA drive, whereas
.IR "/dev/sdb"
is the second SCSI, SATA, USB, or other SCSI-equivalent drive. To use
.BR "gdisk",
you must pass a device filename to the program on the command line.

The
.I partition
is a
device name followed by a partition number.  For example,
.B /dev/hda1
is the first partition on the first PATA hard disk.
.B gdisk
creates partitions, but you don't pass partition numbers or partition
device filenames to the program. Linux generates numbers for GPT partitions
based on the partition's position in the partition table.

The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of cylinder/head/sector
(CHS) addressing and logical block addressing (LBA). The former is klunky
and limiting. GPT drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode
exclusively. Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore
.BR "gdisk",
do not need to deal with CHS geometries and all the problems they create.
Users of
.BR "fdisk"
will note that
.B "gdisk"
lacks the options and limitations associated with CHS geometries.

For best results, you should always use an OS-specific partition table
program.  For example, you should make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS
X Disk Utility
program and Linux partitions with the Linux
.B "gdisk"
or GNU Parted program.

Upon start,
.B gdisk
attempts to identify the partition type in use on the specified disk. If it
finds valid GPT data,
.B gdisk
will use it. If
.B gdisk
finds a valid MBR but no GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR into
GPT form. Upon exiting with the 'w' option,
.B gdisk
will then replace the MBR with a GPT.
.IR "This action is potentially dangerous!"
Your system may become unbootable, and partition type codes may become
corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot problems are
particularly likely if you're multi-booting with any GPT-unaware OS. If you
mistakenly launch
.B gdisk
on an MBR disk, you can safely exit the program
without making any changes by using the 'q' option.

The MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in the partition
numbering if the original MBR used logical partitions. These gaps are
harmless, but you can eliminate them by using the 's' option, if you like.
(Doing this may require you to update your
.IR "/etc/fstab"
file.)

When creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in
order:

.TP
.B *
For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers
with GRUB as the boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order
and in whatever sizes are desired.

.TP
.B *
Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an
.IR "EFI System Partition" (
.B "gdisk"
internal code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32. The recommended size of this
partition is 100 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU
Parted identifies such partitions as having the "boot flag" set.)

.TP
.B *
If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of type "Microsoft
Reserved" (
.B "gdisk"
internal code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB
in size. It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and immediately
precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that GNU Parted creates all
FAT partitions as this type, which actually makes the partition unusable
for normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)

.TP
.B *
Some OSes' GPT utilities create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after
each partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to use this
space. Such free space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may
help in future disk maintenance.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-l
List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit.
.PP

Most interactions with
.B gdisk
occur with its interactive text-mode menus. The main menu provides the
following options:

.TP
.B c
Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16
string, but
.B gdisk
supports only ASCII characters as names. For the most part, Linux ignores
the partition name, but it may be important in some OSes.

.TP
.B d
Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from the partition table
but does not disturb the data within the sectors originally allocated to
the partition on the disk.

.TP
.B i
Show detailed partition information. The summary information produced by
the 'p' command necessarily omits many details, such as the partition's
unique GUID and the translation of
.BR "gdisk"'s
internal partition type code to a plain type name. The 'i' option
displays this information for a single partition.

.TP
.B l
Display a summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID to identify
partition types for particular OSes and purposes. For ease of data entry,
.B gdisk
compresses these into two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are
related to their MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR code is multiplied by
hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the code for Linux swap space in MBR is
0x82, and it's 0x8200 in
.BR "gdisk".
A one-to-one correspondence is impossible, though. Most notably, many DOS,
Windows, and Linux data partition codes correspond to a single GPT code
(entered as 0x0700 in
.BR "gdisk" ).
Some OSes use a single MBR code but employ many more codes in GPT. For
these,
.B gdisk
adds code numbers sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel,
0xa501 for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap, and so on. Note that
these two-byte codes are unique to
.BR "gdisk".

.TP
.B m
Print the menu. Type this command (or any other unrecognized command) to
see a summary of available options.

.TP
.B n
Create a new partition. This command is modelled after the equivalent
.B fdisk
option, although some differences exist. You enter a partition number,
starting sector, and either an ending sector or increment (in integral
multiples of sectors, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes). You
must also set a partition type code.

.TP
.B o
Clear out all partition data. This includes GPT header data,
all partition definitions, and the protective MBR.

.TP
.B p
Display basic partition summary data. This includes partition
numbers, starting and ending sector numbers, partition sizes,
.BR "gdisk"'s
partition types codes, and partition names. For additional information,
use the 'i' command.

.TP
.B q
Quit from the program
.IR "without saving data".
Use it if you just wanted to view information or if you make a mistake and
want to back out of all your changes.

.TP
.B s
Sort partition entries. GPT partition numbers need not match the order of
partitions on the disk. If you want them to match, you can use this option.
Note that some partitioning utilities, such as GNU Parted, will sort
partitions whenever they make changes. Such changes will be reflected in
your Linux device filenames, so you may need to edit
.IR "/etc/fstab"
if you use this option.

.TP
.B t
Change a single partition's type code. You enter the type code using a
two-byte hexadecimal number, as described earlier. You may also enter a
GUID directly, if you have one and
.B gdisk
doesn't know it.

.TP
.B v
Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of problems, such as
incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and backup data. This option does not
automatically correct these problems, though; for that, you must use
options on the experts' menu. If no problems are found, this command
displays a summary of unallocated disk space.

.TP
.B w
Write data. Use this command to save your changes.

.TP
.B x
Enter the experts' menu. Using this option provides access to features you
can use to get into even more trouble than the main menu allows.
.PP

A few options on the experts' menu duplicate functionality on the main
menu, for the sake of convenience; however, for the most part the experts'
menu provides unusually dangerous or obscure options. These are:

.TP
.B a
Set attributes. GPT provides a 64-bit attributes field that can be used to
set partition features.
.B gdisk
supports four attributes: 
.IR "system partition",
.IR "read-only",
.IR "hidden",
and
.IR "do not automount".
You can set other attributes, but their numbers aren't translated into
anything useful. In practice, most OSes seem to ignore these attributes.
.TP
.B b
Rebuild main GPT header from backup. You can use the backup GPT header to
rebuild the main GPT header with this option. It's likely to be useful if
your main GPT header was damaged or destroyed (say, by sloppy use of
.IR "dd").
.TP
.B c
Load backup partition table. Ordinarily,
.B gdisk
uses only the main partition table (although the backup's integrity is
checked when you launch the program). If the main partition table has been
damaged, you can use this option to load the backup from disk and use it
instead. Note that this will almost certainly produce no or strange
partition entries if you've just converted an MBR disk to GPT format, since
there will be no backup partition table on disk.

.TP
.B d
Use main GPT header and rebuild the backup. This option is likely to be
useful if the backup GPT header has been damaged or destroyed.
.TP

.B e
Load main partition table. This option reloads the main partition table
from disk. It's only likely to be useful if you've tried to use the backup
partition table (via 'c') but it's in worse shape then the main partition
table.
.TP

.B f
Change partition GUID. You can enter a custom unique GUID for a partition
using this option. (Note this refers to the GUID that uniquely identifies a
partition, not to its type code.) Ordinarily,
.B gdisk
assigns this number randomly; however, you might want to adjust the number
manually if you've wound up with the same GUID on two partitions.
.TP
.B g
Change disk GUID. Each disk has a unique GUID code, which
.B gdisk
assigns randomly upon creation of the GPT data structures. You can generate
a fresh random GUID or enter one manually with this option.

.TP
.B h
Create a hybrid MBR. This is an ugly workaround that enables GPT-unaware
OSes, or that that can't boot from a GPT disk, to access up to three of
the partitions on the disk by creating MBR entries for them. Note that
these hybrid MBR entries are not updated when you make subsequent changes
to the GPT entries, so you must re-run this option whenever you make
changes that would affect the hybridized partitions.

.TP
.B i
Show detailed partition information. This option is identical to the 'i'
option on the main menu.
.TP
.B k
Save partition data to a backup file. You can back up your partition table
to a disk file using this option. The resulting file is a binary file
consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the backup GPT
header, and one copy of the partition table, in that order.
.TP
.B l
Load partition data from a backup file. This option is the reverse of the 'k'
option. Note that restoring partition data from anything but the
original disk is not recommended.
.TP
.B m
Print the menu. This option (or any unrecognized entry) displays a summary
of the menu options.
.TP
.B n
Create a new protective MBR. Use this option if the current protective MBR
is damaged in a way that
.B gdisk
doesn't automatically detect and correct.
.TP
.B o
Print protective MBR data. You can see a summary of the protective MBR's
partitions with this option. This may enable you to spot glaring problems
or help identify the partitions in a hybrid MBR.
.TP
.B p
Print the partition table. This option is identical to the 'p' option in
the main menu.
.TP
.B q
Quit without saving changes. This option is identical to the 'q' option in
the main menu.
.TP
.B r
Return to the main menu. You can go back to the main menu with this option.
.TP
.B s
Resize partition table. The partition table may be resized with this
option. The default size is 128 entries. Officially, sizes of less than
16KB (128 entries, given the normal entry size) are unsupported by the GPT
specification; however, in practice they seem to work, and can sometimes be
useful in converting MBR disks. Larger sizes also work fine. Linux imposes
its own limits on the number of partitions, though.
.TP
.B v
Verify disk. This option is identical to the 'v' option in the main menu.
.TP
.B w
Write table to disk and exit. This option is identical to the 'w' option in
the main menu.

.TP
.B z
Destroy the GPT data structures and exit. Use this option if you want to
repartition a GPT disk using 
.B "fdisk"
or some other GPT-unaware program.
You'll be given the choice of preserving the existing MBR, in case it's a
hybrid MBR with salvageable partitions.

.PP

In many cases, you can press the Enter key to select a default option when
entering data. When only one option is possible,
.B gdisk
usually bypasses the prompt entirely.

.SH BUGS
As of August of 2009 (version 0.3.3),
.B gdisk
should be considered early beta software. Known bugs and
limitations include:

.TP
.B *
The program runs correctly only on little-endian (Intel and similar) CPUs.
It should fail gracefully on PowerPC and other big-endian CPUs, but this
hasn't been tested.

.TP
.B *
The program compiles correctly only on Linux and Mac OS X. Both 64-bit
(x86-64) and 32-bit (x86) versions for Linux have been tested, the former
more thoroughly than the latter. The Mac OS X support was added with
version 0.3.1 and has not been thoroughly tested.

.TP
.B *
The fields used to display the start and end sector numbers for partitions
in the 'p' command are 14 characters wide. This translates to a limitation
of about 45 PiB. On larger disks, the displayed columns will go out of
alignment.

.TP
.B *
Only ASCII characters are supported in the partition name field. If an
existing partition uses non-ASCII UTF-16 characters, they're likely to be
corrupted in the 'i' menu option's display; however, they should be
preserved when loading and saving partitions.

.TP
.B *
The program can load only up to 124 logical partitions when converting from
MBR format. This limit can be raised by changing the #define NUM_LOGICALS
line in the
.IR "mbr.cc"
source code file and recompiling; however, such a change will require using
a larger-than-normal GPT partition table. (The limit of 124 logical
partitions was chosen because that number plus the four primary partitions
equals the 128 partitions supported by the most common GPT partition table
size.)

.TP
.B *
Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of insufficient space at
the start or (more commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the partition
table (using the 's' option in the experts' menu) can sometimes overcome
this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary to resize a
partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool.

.TP
.B *
Converting from MBR supports only one extended partition. If multiple
extended partitions are found, only the final extended partition's logical
partitions are guaranteed to be converted intact; some or all of the
earlier extended partition(s) logical partitions will be lost.

.TP
.B *
MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA partition
descriptors. These descriptors should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in
size or on smaller disks partitioned with any but very ancient software.

.TP
.B *
If an MBR disk contains a FreeBSD disklabel partition, it's converted
in-place as such rather than splitting out its constituent disklabel
partitions into GPT partitions. Other OSes' disklabel partitions may not
get appropriate GUID type codes at all.

.TP
.B *
Booting after converting an MBR disk may be disrupted. Sometimes
re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem, but other times you may
need to switch boot loaders. Except on EFI-based platforms, Windows through
at least Windows 7 RC doesn't support booting from GPT disks. Creating a
hybrid MBR (using the 'h' option on the experts' menu) or abandoning GPT in
favor of MBR may be your only options in this case.
