0.3.2:
------

- Changed __DARWIN_UNIX03 to __APPLE__ as code to enable MacOS X support.

0.3.1:
------

- Added Mac OS X support, provided as a patch by an anonymous contributor.

- Fixed bug in disksize() function on Mac OS. (Possibly dependent on the
  kernel and/or GCC version.) The disk size, of type uint64_t, was not
  being passed correctly, so I reorganized the function to return it as
  the function's return value rather than as a parameter. This seems to
  work OK on my Mac OS test system and on both 32- and 64-bit Linux
  systems.

- Added test for writability when opening a disk for reading. If the
  test fails, a warning message is displayed. (The test simply opens
  the disk for writing and then closes it before writing any data,
  so the test shouldn't cause problems.)

- Fixed off-by-one bug in GPTData::FindLastAvailable().

- Fixed bug that caused display of options after a disk-write error.

- Fixed several incorrect MacOS X partition type GUIDs.

0.3.0:
------

- Changed version number to 0.3.0, reflecting the fact that I've received
  no significant bug reports and so am elevating the program to "beta"
  status. This change also entailed altering the warning the program
  displays when saving partition table changes.

- Fixed minor bug in CHS geometry of the protective MBR's type EE partition
  (was producing 0x000200 as the start value, but should be 0x000100).
  Should be a non-critical bug since the protective MBR partition
  definition is only there to keep MBR-only disk utilities from messing
  with the disk.

- Added ability to enter GUIDs as single massive strings rather than in
  chunks.

0.2.2:
------

- Added #include directives required to compile the program using GCC
  4.4.0.

0.2.1:
------

- Fixed partition numbering problem in reports of partition overlaps in
  verification function.

- Fixed 1-sector partition size problem when creating new partitions
  (partitions were 1 sector too big when using the +size option).

- Changed BytesToSI() to display values in bytes without decimal points
  (e.g., "512 bytes" rather than "512.0 bytes").

- Added GPTData class member functions to retrieve GPT data structure
  locations on disk; used in my internal-use-only GPT-wiping program.

- Eliminated the "a reboot is recommended" notice after writing the
  partition table.

- Added notice after sorting the partition table to the effect that
  editing /etc/fstab and/or the boot loader files may be required.

- Fixed bug in MBR-reading function that caused 0x0f (Win95 LBA) and 0x85
  (Linux extended) extended partitions to not be read.

- Fixed bug in GetLastSector() (in support.cc) that would have prevented
  correct user entry of over-32-bit sector numbers on 32-bit systems.

- Made some changes/corrections to the partition type list in
  parttypes.cc. Most of these were based on newly-discovered MBR type
  codes for Apple (Mac OS X) filesystems.

- General code cleanup (setting explicit casts, etc.)

0.2.0:
------

- Initial semi-public release
